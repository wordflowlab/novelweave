# Using v0 With NovelWeave

NovelWeave supports v0, Vercel's AI model provider that offers an OpenAI-compatible API. This allows you to use v0's models with NovelWeave through the familiar OpenAI API interface.

## Prerequisites

To use v0 with NovelWeave, you'll need:

- A team account with Vercel v0
- A v0 API key

## Configuration

Setting up v0 in NovelWeave is straightforward:

1. In NovelWeave settings (click the <Codicon name="gear" /> icon):
    - Under **API Provider**, select: **OpenAI Compatible**
    - Set the **Base URL**: `https://api.v0.dev/v1`
    - Paste in your v0 API key
    - Set the **Model ID**: `v0-1.0-md`
    - Click **Verify** to confirm the connection
